john f kennedy inaugural address delivered 20 january 1961vice president johnson mr speaker mr chief justice president eisenhower vice president nixon president truman reverend clergy fellow citizens:we observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom  symbolizing an end as well as a beginning  signifying renewal as well as change for i have sworn before you and almighty god the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and threequarters agothe world is very different now for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe  the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of godwe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans  born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the worldlet every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of libertythis much we pledge  and moreto those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends united there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures divided there is little we can do  for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunderto those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny we shall not always expect to find them supporting our view but we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom  and to remember that in the past those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up insideto those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves for whatever period is required  not because the communists may be doing it not because we seek their votes but because it is right if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are richto our sister republics south of our border we offer a special pledge: to convert our good words into good deeds in a new alliance for progress to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty but this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the americas and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own houseto that world assembly of sovereign states the united nations our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace we renew our pledge of support  to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in which its writ may runfinally to those nations who would make themselves our adversary we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental selfdestructionwe dare not tempt them with weakness for only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employedbut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course  both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind’s final warso let us begin anew  remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness and sincerity is always subject to proof let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiatelet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide uslet both sides for the first time formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nationslet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors together let us explore the stars conquer the deserts eradicate disease tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commercelet both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of isaiah  to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free”and if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion let both sides join in creating a new endeavor  not a new balance of power but a new world of law  where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preservedall this will not be finished in the first one hundred days nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days; nor in the life of this administration; nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but let us beginin your hands my fellow citizens more than mine will rest the final success or failure of our course since this country was founded each generation of americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty the graves of young americans who answered the call to service surround the globenow the trumpet summons us again  not as a call to bear arms though arms we need  not as a call to battle though embattled we are  but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle year in and year out rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation” a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny poverty disease and war itselfcan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance north and south east and west that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? will you join in that historic effort?in the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger i do not shrink from this responsibility  i welcome it i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation the energy the faith the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the worldand so my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your countrymy fellow citizens of the world ask not what america will do for you but what together we can do for the freedom of manfinally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you with a good conscience our only sure reward with history the final judge of our deeds let us go forth to lead the land we love asking his blessing and his help but knowing that here on earth god's work must truly be our ownmartin luther king jr i have a dream delivered 28 august 1963 at the lincoln memorial washington dci am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nationfive score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivitybut one hundred years later the negro still is not free one hundred years later the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity one hundred years later the negro is still languished in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land and so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful conditionin a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir this note was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights” of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness” it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned instead of honoring this sacred obligation america has given the negro people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient funds”but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation and so we've come to cash this check a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justicewe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism now is the time to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood now is the time to make justice a reality for all of god’s childrenit would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment this sweltering summer of the negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality nineteen sixtythree is not an end but a beginning and those who hope that the negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual and there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the negro is granted his citizenship rights the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emergesbut there is something that i must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: in the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul forcethe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom we cannot walk aloneand as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march aheadwe cannot turn backthere are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights when will you be satisfied?” we can never be satisfied as long as the negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities we cannot be satisfied as long as the negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: for whites only” we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote no no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream”i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells and some of you have come from areas where your quest  quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality you have been the veterans of creative suffering continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive go back to mississippi go back to alabama go back to south carolina go back to georgia go back to louisiana go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed let us not wallow in the valley of despair i say to you today my friendsand so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dreami have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal”i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhoodi have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justicei have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character i have a dream todayi have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition” and nullification”  one day right there in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothersi have a dream todayi have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together”this is our hope and this is the faith that i go back to the south withwith this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with this faith we will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free one dayand this will be the day  this will be the day when all of god’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i singland where my fathers died land of the pilgrim’s pride  from every mountainside let freedom ring and if america is to be a great nation this must become true and so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of new hampshirelet freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new yorklet freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania let freedom ring from the snowcapped rockies of coloradolet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of californiabut not only that:let freedom ring from stone mountain of georgialet freedom ring from lookout mountain of tennesseelet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippifrom every mountainside let freedom ringand when this happens and when we allow freedom ring when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet from every state and every city we will be able to speed up that day when all of god’s children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro spiritual:free at last free at lastthank god almighty we are free at last
